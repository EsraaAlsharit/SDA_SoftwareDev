<hr>
Build a new Django application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

The goal is to help you get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. Consider the below example as a guide.

When you build this, please make sure that your program meets the following criteria:

    - http://localhost:8000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/result'
    - http://localhost:8000/result - have this display an HTML page with the information that was submitted by POST

**Don't forget that any inputs we want to be able to access from the form submission need to have a name!**

It's always a good idea to print request.POST to see if the form is delivering all the information you need in your routing method.
